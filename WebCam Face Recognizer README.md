WebCam Face Recognition

The WebCam Face Recognition Software uses OpenCV and Deepface modules to find and record an intruder trying to use your PC.

When the software is executed it:

- Captures the video from the PCs Webcam

- It then detects if a face has appeared in the video

- If a face appears it recognizes if its the PCs user based on training images given to it

- It would then record the video of the person captured and state if they are recognized (USER MATCH) or not (UNIDENTIFIED PERSON)

- The recording would cease once a short period has passed with no face detected in the frame
